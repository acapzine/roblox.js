**A package dedicated to simplifying the countless ROBLOX APIs.**

#### Note: this currently only has elements of the [Users API](https://users.roblox.com/docs/index.html) and the [Groups API](https://groups.roblox.com/docs/index.html), more APIs will be added on as long as I don't rewrite this a bunch of times.

---

## Updates:
- (1.0.0) | Release: TypeScript - General Users & Groups API installed
- (1.0.1) | Release, take 2: TypeScript - I forgot to make it a module-type.. :(
- (1.0.2) | Release, take 3: TypeScript - I forgot to make a thingy work with the JSON response :(
- (1.0.3) | Release, take 4: TypeScript - I completely forgot to recompile the updated TypeScript :( (yes, i will probably have ~19 re-releases bc i keep messing up :( )
- (1.0.4) | Interfaces: TypeScript - I made the dreaded decision to now include custom interfaces for the entirety of the code. It's now 689 lines for the main TypeScript file I keep :(
- (1.0.5) | External Functions: TypeScript - I made it so the functions can be used outside of the classes.. the stuff is getting even longer now.. :(
- (1.0.6) | Different Files: TypeScript - I made it so that the interfaces are in a separate file from the main file so that way it cuts down on the excessive lines

## Roadmap:
- (1.0.7) | Translation: JSDOC - Translate all of this over to JSDOC
